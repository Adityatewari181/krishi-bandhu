**PM-KUSUM Component C — Individual Pump Solarisation (IPS)**

• Target: Solarisation of grid-connected agriculture pumps under Component-C (IPS).

• PV Capacity Allowed: Solar PV capacity up to **two times** the pump capacity in kilowatts (kW).
• Power Use: Farmer uses solar energy for irrigation; **excess power is sold to DISCOMs** at pre-fixed tariffs.
